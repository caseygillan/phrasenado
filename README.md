## Phrasenado

#### Overview

The objective of the game is for the player to guess a famous phrase as the letters in the phrase are spinning. The round starts with 100 points and the total points available for the round decreases as time goes on (ie. the longer the player takes to guess the phrase, the less points they will get).

If a player successfully enters the correct phrase in the input area before time is up, the remaining points will be added to their total score. If time runs out before the player can enter the correct phrase, no points will be awarded.

After 3 rounds, the game is over and the player will recieve an overall score for the game.
